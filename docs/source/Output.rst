Output Description
==================

Description of the main outputs:

* EMACGsingle.sh generates the following output directories:

 1. busco_output_<genome_name>

  It contains the output generated by BUSCO (https://busco.ezlab.org/busco_userguide.html#outputs).

 2. FINAL_RESULT

  It contains the gff, transcripts and protein prediction files generated by MAKER (http://gmod.org/wiki/MAKER_Tutorial#MAKER.27s_Output).

  The hmmsearch results against Pfam database are stored in the subdirectory ``/annotation_pfam``.

  Pfam annotated sequences are extracted, and the resulted annotation file (<genome_name>.gff), and sequences (<genome_name>.faa, <genome_name>.fna) are stored in the subdirectory ``/Genes_with_Pfam_hit``.

 3. log_files

  log files generated during MAKER predictions are stored here.

* EMACGpoly.sh generates a directory named ``Gene_calling_<genome_name>`` containing the previously described directories.
